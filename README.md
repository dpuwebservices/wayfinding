# WayFinding
This is the 2021/22 version of the Wayfinding display map for DePaul JTR Library.

The files in the _PWB-files folder are used by the Public Web Browser app and need to be loaded into the PWB directory of the wayfinding machines. Changes made to the wayfinding site (https://libservices.org/wayfinding/)will not be reflected until PWB is interrupted and restarted (Ctrl-Alt-Shift + Insert, then enter override keyword).
